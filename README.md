# What is Don't Forget The Tea?

Don't Forget The Tea is a boba-themed web application inspired by Remember The Milk, a to-do list website where users can keep track of their tasks and organize them into lists. Our goal is to make getting tasks done a priori-tea!

# Application Architecture
Don't Forget The Tea is built using an Express-based server, a PostgreSQL database, and Pug templates for the front-end. We implemented DOM manipulation for our ‘Edit’ and ‘Delete’ buttons associated with the task without causing a refresh/redirect. This created a dynamic rendering and allows for a uninterrupted user experience.
