# Application Architecture
Don't Forget The Tea is built using an Express-based server, a PostgreSQL database, and Pug templates for the front-end. We implemented DOM manipulation for our ‘Edit’ and ‘Delete’ buttons associated with the task without causing a refresh/redirect. This created a dynamic rendering and allows for a uninterrupted user experience.

# Conclusion and Next Steps
Looking forward, there are several features we would like to implement to improve on the app's functionality. For instance, we want to add a search bar so users can search for lists and tasks. We also want to create smart lists to group tasks into similar categories. In terms of styling, we hope to improve the look on certain features to make the website more appealing.
